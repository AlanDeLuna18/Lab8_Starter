Graceful degradation vs. Service Workers: 
Graceful degradation and service workers are very similar in the sense that they both start with the most amount of technology possible, and then downgrade to the lowest form of technology. For instance, graceful degradation is where we start with the most advanced tools possible and then work downwards towards the smaller, less advanced details about a website or application. Service workers store previous requests from the internet and store that exact same request and its appropriate response. It then is able to access the same data locally in case it ever gets called again. This is similar to graceful degradation since it would work from higher level technologies (the internet) and move downwards to less advanced tools for efficiency (accessing data locally).
